## 📖 Project Overview

**SubSlayer** is a personal finance utility designed to combat "subscription fatigue." In today's digital economy, the average user wastes hundreds of dollars annually on forgotten or unused recurring payments.

I designed and developed this application to provide a centralized, intuitive dashboard where users can visualize their spending, manage renewal dates, and regain control over their financial data. My goal was to build a solution that is not only functional but also scalable and visually elegant.

## ✨ Key Features

* **📊 Smart Dashboard:** A visual breakdown of monthly vs. yearly spending using interactive charts.
* **🔔 Renewal Tracking:** Clear indicators of when the next payment is due to prevent surprise charges.
* **📝 CRUD Functionality:** Users can easily Add, Edit, and Delete subscriptions from their personal database.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Optimized UI that works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.
* **🎨 Modern UX:** Built with a focus on clean aesthetics and accessibility using a high-contrast design system.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I chose a modern, performance-oriented tech stack to ensure the application is fast, type-safe, and scalable:

* **Frontend:** React (TypeScript) for a robust component architecture.
* **Build Tool:** Vite for lightning-fast bundling and development.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI for a professional, consistent design system.
* **Language:** TypeScript to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* **AI Integration:** Implementing OCR to automatically scan bank statements for recurring payments.
* **Smart Alerts:** Email and SMS notifications 3 days before a renewal.
